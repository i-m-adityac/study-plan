Interactive FAANG Study Planner
Overview
This is a comprehensive, single-page web application designed to help software developers with around two years of experience prepare for SDE II interviews at FAANG-tier companies. The planner provides a detailed, 6-month day-by-day schedule based on a scientific approach that includes spaced repetition and a parallel study track for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and System Design.

The application is fully interactive, editable, and saves all user changes to the browser's local storage, making it a persistent and personalized study companion.

Task Completion Tracking: Check off tasks as you complete them to visually track your progress.

Categorized Tagging: Assign a category (e.g., DSA, System Design, Revision) to each task, which automatically applies a corresponding color code.

Clickable Resource Links: Add a URL to any task. A link icon (ðŸ”—) will appear, allowing you to quickly access your study materials.

Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between themes for comfortable viewing in any lighting condition. Your preference is saved.
